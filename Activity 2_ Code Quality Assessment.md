**The problem: Search for a Number in a Sorted List**

**For example: Both algorithms could search:**   
numbers \= \[5, 12, 18, 23, 31, 47, 56, 68, 74, 90\]  
target \= 47

| Implementation 1 | Implementation 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| def linear\_search(numbers, target):    *for* i *in* range(len(numbers)):        *if* numbers\[i\] \== target:            *return* i    *return* \-1   | def binary\_search(numbers, target):    low \= 0    high \= len(numbers) \- 1     *while* low \<= high:        middle \= (low \+ high) // 2         *if* numbers\[middle\] \== target:            *return* middle        *elif* numbers\[middle\] \< target:            low \= middle \+ 1        *else*:            high \= middle \- 1     *return* \-1   |
